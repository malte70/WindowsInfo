				<span class="caps">WindowsInfo</span> shows some useful information
				about a Windows system.
			</p>
			<h2>Graphical User Interface</h2>
			<p>
				Most users will use the GUI. if there wasn't made any shortcut during
				the installation, you must double-click on the file
				<i>WindowsInfo.exe</i> located at the application directory
				(<tt>C:\Program Files\Windows Info</tt>).
			</p>
			<h3>Close <span class="caps">WindowsInfo</span></h3>
			<p>To clode the application window, either click on on the Close button of the window or select File&rarr;Exit.</p>
			<h3>Change view</h3>
			<p>
				Per default, <span class="caps">WindowsInfo</span> shows the information
				in a neat format, like in Version 0.1.2. By selecting on View&rarr;Detailed
				the detailed view can be selected. The information is shown just like
				<tt>WindowsInfo.CLI.exe</tt> would do.
